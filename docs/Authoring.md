## Front Matter Conventions

Use these optional keys in posts, projects, or features to integrate with the magazine-style homepage:

```yaml
cover: /assets/covers/<file>.jpg
featured: true
categories: FPV
# or
# tags: [FPV]
```

Items marked `featured: true` appear in the homepage's featured section.
`categories` or `tags` are used to populate topic sections.
