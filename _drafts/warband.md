# Putting together my warband

I'm finally putting real effort and focus into putting my warband together, one unit at a time. I got very distracted starting a Dwarf Guild army together as well as just sort of...being depressed and lazy for a while. But now that things are looking better and I'm really starting to see some improvement in my painting I'm really jazzed to finally throw some junk on a table and start playing Frostgrave. 

## What and why?

Your warband is your group of adventurers, searching the frozen city for loot and fending off roaming monsters. It includes your wizard, the closest thing to an actual player character you'll use in Frostgrave as well as your apprentice. They're basically a less powerful version of your wizard. The rest of your warband is filled out with various warriors. There aren't skills in this game, and your non magical characters don't gain any levels. They can only improve through the addition of magical weapons and items. 

The bulk of your warband will of course be the assorted offensive classes. Simple thugs that cost no money all the way to fully armored knights when you can afford them. Since my wife and I are very new, haven't even played yet, I don't need ten of every single model, but I do need at least 20 models to represent the two warbands.

Your archers, thugs, thieves, men at arms etc. do the actual work. They'll carry treasure, fight off monsters and die in the effort of gaining the riches of Felstad. They are not exactly disposable, but it's probably best not to name them...

Your wizard and apprentice lead the warband. They're the only magical classes, the only ones who can cast spells. They also gain levels and become more powerful as you progress through the campaign. Something of note, they're not really "hero" characters in the current sense. They are not super powerful nor do they require special models. They are still very much in line with the power of the rest of the warband. 

## Warband assemble!

I realize this is very obvious and I should have just done this from the start, but I recently had the epiphany that the easiest way to get everything printed and painted would be to just fill out our character sheets and print just those models. 

For some reason I had gotten hung up on printing and painting every possible model we would need before I played a single game. I have dozens of various models based and ready, but they're just random fantasy models that don't really fit what I need as well as a bunch of zombies and skeletons that have no adventurers to kill. I spent the last year vainly trying to get everything ready. Now I'm ready to print what I need and go from there. 

### Wizard & Apprentice

I really didn't want to overthink this, I wanted to focus on getting a cool looking model out that would be fun to paint and get on the table. I just made a regular human wizard who looks like he's summoning something, as I'm using a wizard in the summoning school of magic. I did make sure his gear was accurate to the character, I want as close as possible to what you'd get with the Osprey models you can get with Frostgrave. 

### Front Line

I'm not going to bore my self going over every class in the game. They cover a nice variety of classic fantasy classes. For my first warband I'm making sure it'll work with the campaign mode of play, so I bought a few classes then filled out the rest with free thugs and thieves. These fine lads and lasses fill out the front line of my warband.
