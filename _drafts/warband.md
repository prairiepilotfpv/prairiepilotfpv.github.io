# Get it together!

Now that I have a deadly ice worm to harry adventurers, I need some adventurers! I put off finishing a couple of basic warbands for my wife and I in favor of starting a Dwarf Guild army. I didn't finish that either, but after a year of farting around and sort of dealing with my stupid brain I'm finally ready to get the lead out. A worm does not a game make, so lets get some thugs and archers ready to deploy!

## Not an ad!

I used Titancraft. Finding minis that are all of a similiar art style with consistent scaling is a pain, even scouring MMF for hours on end. I had good luck with Titancraft before and I haven't had a chance to try out the new items I got for backing their kickstarter last year. I sat down with the core book and made a quick army list and took that to the character creator.
