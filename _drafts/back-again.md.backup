# Boy Howdy

It's been a long time since I've gotten on here and posted anything. This blog was meant to be a clearing house for my thoughts and a tool to help with accountability. I had dreams of a picture perfect blog, with fun little photos and a nice ToC for every post. 

It was a nice idea, and I don't think I was totally wrong, or I wouldn't be here writing this and planning on publishing it, would I? I do think I wasn't really in a good place to try and take on any new creative task.

## Bad Habits

For a long time since getting on meds and trying to be a more functional person, I've struggled with enjoying my self when I'm doing things... I enjoy. There has been a log jam in my head, and it's still mostly there, where I can't just relax and have fun even if it's something I want to do. For most of '23 and '24 I clenched my teeth through everything I tried to do till I burned my self out. I stopped working on almost anything, I played lots of video games and limped my way through the holidays.

I told my self I'd get back to work on my projects as soon as, well, as soon as something happened. There was always something. Eventually, I ran out of excuses and really think about why I didn't want to do my favorite things. 

There was such a fear built up, an edge to any attempt at fun or creativity or anything that's not "productive", that I totally gave up without admitting I'd given up. I always found another excuse to avoid painting, or modeling, or doing anything I actually like doing. Even the little bit of hobby time I spent, taking photos or working on videos, never went anywhere. I couldn't look at the preview screen without finding something to shit on my self for. 

Before long, I had settled into a nice ryhthem. I worked all day, miserable that I couldn't be at home working on my projects, then as soon as I got home, I'd get good and high and find some excuses why I can't do anything. Eventually it's too late to work on anything, so I can have my tea and imagine a world where I actually work on stuff. 

## Do it my way

It came down to my mental state, not my meds, my diet, or anything else. I need more sleep, always, and I had to give up caffiene, but that just helped me see more clearly: I really *was* my own worst enemy. When I was 20 it was funny, and it made you seem more mature to admit it. Now, at 40, I'm sick of it. I can't finish a 32mm model for a game of Frostgrave because I can't paint the details without torturing my self.

And heres the worst part: when your internal monologue is all critisim and self abuse, you really *don't* get any better. Instead of focusing on the project in a holistic, enjoyable way, I had a checklist of things I was doing wrong till I found a reason to just give up. It was self defeat of the highest order. It was over the top, I'd drive for an hour looking for a good spot for some photos, and the entire time go over all the reasons I'm too stupid and too old to take good photos. By the time I got my tripod out of the car, there wasn't a chance I'd enjoy it. I'd take one photo, frown, and go home. 

## Some light

So I gave up. But I gave up on my terms, for once. I didn't fall into another dark day, I didn't mope around till my dopamine caught up and I got all hyper. I just stepped away from all the hobbies I was torturing my self with. Mini painting, videos, 3D printing, etc etc, I put it all to the side. If the mood caught me, I didn't fight the urge, but otherwise I let it gather dust. I kept my camera on me, out of guilt for spending money I didn't have, but I stopped forcing my self to take as many photos as I can every day. 

I've always looked down my nose at people who take breaks from their hobbies. Who needs to take a break, just let your thoughts grind you into paste until you don't want to do anything any way. A few days later, you suddenly feel way better, and start a whole new project you can get frustrated with till the cycle starts over again! I looked down at my self for taking a break. I thought it was weak, how do I get better at anything by taking a break from it? I knew I'd give up again soon enough.

But I was right. It was great not to feel a panic everytime I get home that if I don't start something, anything, as soon as I get home I'm wasting my life. It was hard pushing against my usual urge to be mindlessly productive, but I also have an urge to punish my self for not doing enough. Or not doing it right, or not doing the right thing. Fuck it, just skip to the part where I feel better.

## Back in saddle

This isn't a come to Jesus story. This wasn't the moment that changed it all. It was another learning moment as I go through the steps I didn't go through all those years ago as an early adult.

I built a mindset that punished me for anything less than perfection. If I couldn’t one-shot a project, I saw it as a failure—not worth doing. Taking time off helped me step back and realize how that mindset stripped away all the joy and learning from the process.

A huge part other process is just seeing this stuff for what it is. Realizing how you're really talking to your self, how you're approaching tasks. Even trying to have fun ended up in the same blender, it ended up coming out the same way: Alex, why aren't you better at this yet? That's a horrible way to live, but it's easy to let it fester. The more I tried, the more I failed, the more I failed the more ammo I had to tear my self apart the next time I had the temerity to try.

## What now?

After I simply couldn't stand not working on my hobbies, I decided to get back in, with one major caveat: enjoy your self. Weather that means working in short sprints, zoning out with a podcast and working for hours, taking pics, spending two hours on a  mini with nothing to show for it, whatever. As long as I'm having fun, or at least enjoying my self.

Part of enjoying my self is allowing myself to choose what I work on. I was so caught up with what I **should** do, I wasn't spending a moment on what I want to do. Sometimes I'd even change how I'm doing it to do it the right way. So, no more, unless I'm just avoiding something else, if I want to work on a different project today, I'm gonna work on it. 

Another point I'm still learning, is to take a bit of pride in what I've done. I was raised by parents proud of how hard they were on them selves. My mother was a baker and taught me that you should always see the flaws everyone else misses. You should be your hardest critic, to an extreme degree. That's fine if you're a master at your craft, pushing your self to new heights. It's not so useful if you're just trying to get better at layering paints for a nice transition on a 1" mini. So now I actually *look* at my minis, when I'm done, I take a moment and appreicate when I design something that works. When I manage to nail a design on the first print I actually pump my fists and take a bit of joy in what I'm doing.



## Relax, don't do it

What it all really comes down to, is being my own worst enemy. I'm too old to keep holding on to things that hurt me and hurt my progress towards being a somewhat happy person eventually. It doesn't matter who I learned it from, or why. It doesn't help me, it doesn't help anyone I care about. Especially as I get older, and see old age on the horizon, I simply don't want to be that stubborn old man that refuses to let go of their bad habits, their nasty thoughts. It just doesn't feel good being so mean to my self anymore. I'm almost 41, it doesn't work, talking down to my self doesn't make me better at anything.

I'm not a brand new man, it's not a brand new day. I can see some light on the edge of the horizon, but there's plenty of road left in front of me. I *can* take decent photos, and paint mini's to a high standard. I'm not bad at designing objects for printing. The point is to enjoy life, failures and all. Even if I'm stuck at mediocre, I'll be fine, as long as I get the damn thing done.
