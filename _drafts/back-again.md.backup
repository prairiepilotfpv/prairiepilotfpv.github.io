# Boy Howdy

Boy, howdy! It's been too long since I've gotten on here and chatted a bit. My original plan was to use the blog to encourage me to share what I'm working on. I wanted to post regular updates, as well as finished projects. This was supposed to be a bit of a clearing house for everything I'm working on, something to give me motivation and orginization. That sure didn't happen, at all. 

It was a nice idea, and I don't think I was totally wrong, or I wouldn't be here writing this and planning on publishing it, would I? I do think I wasn't really in a good place to try and take on any new creative task. 

## Bad Habits

For a long time since getting on meds and trying to be a more functional person, I've struggled with enjoying my self when I'm doing things... I enjoy. There has been a log jam in my head, and it's still mostly there, where I can't just relax and have fun even if it's something I want to do. For most of '23 and '24 I clenched my teeth through everything I tried to do till I burned my self out. I stopped working on almost anything, I played lots of video games and limped my way through the holidays. 

I kept telling my self when I had more time I'd start back up again, but even as my daughter moved into the dorms and life setteled down after the holidays, it was still a slog to make my self do anything creative or to enjoy the rare times I did sit down to work on a 3D print, or to paint a mini. 

There was such a fear built up, an edge to any attempt at fun or creativity or anything that's not "productive", that I totally gave up without admitting I'd given up. I always found another excuse to avoid painting, or modeling, or doing anything I actually like doing. The only thing I've managed to keep up with at all is my photography, but even that's been petering out for a while. 

Before long, I had settled into a nice ryhthem. I worked all day, miserable that I couldn't be at home working on my projects, then as soon as I got home, I'd get good and high and find some excuses why I can't do anything. Eventually it's too late to work on anything, so I can have my tea and imagine a world where I actually work on stuff. 

## Do it my way

The more I tried to force it, the less I got done, till, yeah, the above. Eventually I'd had one too many bad days, too many episodes, and I was ready to figure out what's going on with me. I was, and am, doing better than ever. Getting bills paid on time, learning how to finish things, getting chores like laundry and sweeping built into my day-to-day life. But I still couldn't start a project and work on it till it was done. Not even the ADHD version where you do Pomodoro timers or chunk it into tiny little jobs you can knock out easier than the whole thing. 

It came down to my mental state, not my meds, my diet, or anything else. I need more sleep, always, and I had to give up caffiene, but that just helped me see more clearly: I really *was* my own worst enemy. When I was 20 it was funny, and it made you seem more mature to admit it. Now, at 40, I'm sick of it. I can't finish a 32mm model for a game of Frostgrave because I can't paint the details without torturing my self. 

And heres the worst part: when your internal monologue is all critisim and self abuse, you really *don't* get any better. Instead of focusing on the project in a holistic, enjoyable way, I had a checklist of things I was doing wrong till I found a reason to just give up. It was self defeat of the highest order. It was over the top, I'd drive for an hour looking for a good spot for some photos, and the entire time go over all the reasons I'm too stupid and too old to take good photos. By the time I got my tripod out of the car, there wasn't a chance I'd enjoy it. 

## Some light

So I gave up. But I gave up on my terms, for once. I didn't fall into another dark day, I didn't mope around for a few days till my dopamine caught up and I got all hyper. I just stepped away from all the hobbies I was torturing my self with. Mini painting, videos, 3D printing, etc etc, I put it all to the side. If the mood caught me, I didn't fight the urge, but otherwise I let it gather dust. 

I've always looked down my nose at people who take breaks from their hobbies. Who needs to take a break, just let your thoughts grind you into paste until you don't want to do anything any way. A few days later, you suddenly feel way better, and start a whole new project you can get frustrated with till the cycle starts over again! I looked down at my self for taking a break. I thought it was weak, how do I get better at anything by taking a break from it? I knew I'd give up again soon enough. 

But I was right. It was great not to feel a panic everytime I get home that if I don't start something, anything, as soon as I get home I'm wasting my life. It was hard pushing against my usual urge to be mindlessly productive, but I also have an urge to punish my self for not doing enough. Or not doing it right, or not doing the right thing. Fuck it, just skip to the part where I feel better. 

## Back in saddle

This isn't a come to Jesus story. This wasn't the moment that changed it all. It was another learning moment as I go through the steps I didn't go through all those years ago as an early adult.

I let my self build a whole system in my head to punish my self no matter what. I'm failing if I do anything but one-shot everything I do, so no point in doing anything. Taking the time off gave me a great chance to analyze those feelings, to step back and look at how I persue projects, how I manage to strip all the fun out. Every step I go over with a fine toothed comb to ensure I don't have fun and don't take anything from the process either. 

A huge part other process is just seeing this stuff for what it is. Realizing how you're really talking to your self, how you're approaching tasks. Even trying to have fun ended up in the same blender, it ended up coming out the same way: Alex, why aren't you better at this yet? That's a horrible way to live, but it's easy to let it fester. The more I tried, the more I failed, the more I failed the more ammo I had to tear my self apart the next time I had the temerity to try. 

## What now?

After I simply couldn't stand not working on my hobbies, I decided to get back in, with one major caveat: enjoy your self. Weather that means working in short sprints, zoning out with a podcast and working for hours, taking pics, spending two hours on a  mini with nothing to show for it, whatever. As long as I'm having fun, or at least enjoying my self. 

There are quite a few other, smaller things I learned along the way. For one, work on what I want to work on. Sure, if there is something I want to get done, maybe I need to grit my teeth and work on that. But if there is something I *want* to work on, and there is nothing more pressing, then work on that! Also, none of this is pressing! It's all supposed to be fun! 

Another point I'm still learning, is to take a bit of pride in what I've done. I was raised by parents proud of how hard they were on them selves. My mother was a baker and taught me that you should always see the flaws everyone else misses. You should be your hardest critic, to an extreme degree. That's fine if you're a master at your craft, pushing your self to new heights. It's not so useful if you're just trying to get better at layering paints for a nice transition on a 1" mini. So now I actually *look* at my minis, when I'm done, I take a moment and appreicate when I design something that works. When I manage to nail a design on the first print I actually pump my fists and take a bit of joy in what I'm doing. 

There are so many more little things I've learned taking a break from my hobbies, too many to get into in a blog post. Just fun little revelations throughout the last few months, moments where I stop and think "oh, *thats* how that works" and move another step forward. 

## Relax, don't do it

What it all really comes down to, is being my own worst enemy. I'm too old to keep holding on to things that hurt me and hurt my progress towards being a somewhat happy person eventually. It doesn't matter who I learned it from, or why. It doesn't help me, it doesn't help anyone I care about. Especially as I get older, and see old age on the horizon, I simply don't want to be that stubborn old man that refuses to let go of their bad habits, their nasty thoughts. It just doesn't feel good being so mean to my self anymore. I'm almost 41, it doesn't work, talking down to my self doesn't make me better at anything. 

I'm not a brand new man, it's not a brand new day. I don't think everything is fixed, and I'm still struggling to get past my usual brake points where I hammer my self with self doubt and self critisizm, but at least I can see some light. I AM a pretty decent mini painter, and I actually can learn how to do things. I can learn them in a deeper, more useful way than before sobriety and my meds. But it doesn't happen overnight, and I'm probably never going to be the best at anything. And that's fine. I can say that much: that's fine. I'd rather be mediocre but getting the damn thing done, then the best, and never finishing a project.
