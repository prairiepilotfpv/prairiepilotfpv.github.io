Christmas 2023 I decided to really push my self to make something special for my wife. She does like nice things, but prefers to pick them her self and she loves a nice surprise on Christmas morning, so a DIY bit of work is the best bet. Also, I'm not nearly as good with money as she is, so I don't have designer bag money, unfortunately. I have put a lot of work in this year to get better and printing and painting minis, and I thought a simple, but lovingly made diorama of her favorite comic character would hit the spot.

## Off to a great start

I just happened to find a great model cruising MMF Black Friday looking for inspiration, a chap named [Dwogan](https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-dwogan-mithrilclaw-raging-315971) from [Codex  Universalis](https://www.myminifactory.com/users/CodexUniversalis). I actually wanted to find something other than a strictly accurate comic book Wolverine. I think a plain bust is a bit dull and I didn't have the time or skill to do a high quality painting of a bust. So Dwogan it is!

I also subscribe to [Custom Miniature Maker](https://www.customminiaturemaker.co.uk/) and it just so happens that their recent releases include some very nice pieces of fantasy props/terrain. Between the new stuff
