# A very mini Christmas

I put together a fun little mini diorama as a Christmas gift for my wife. She's a fan of Wolverine and off and on throughout our relationship I like to occasionally drop a unique or unusual bit of Wolverine kitsch as a present. I wanted to do something hand made this year, something that had more effort and time spent than money. I also wanted to focus on using what I already have on hand. I've got lots of models to choose from, plenty of paint and supplies, this is a gift for my wife, not an excuse to buy more stuff. I knew I'd have to get the Wolverine model, so that was my hard cap and I did my looking during [MMF](https://www.myminifactory.com) Black Friday to keep it nice and tidy. 

## Round Up The Essentials

When I saw [Dwogan](https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-dwogan-mithrilclaw-raging-315971) he went straight to my cart. I wasn't sure what I'd do with him, but I knew I could do something with him!

And here he is! He didn't come out perfect, but very close. Truth be told, I didn't have a lot of faith that my FEP replacement and change of resin would hold up, so I took what I got and ran for it. I was looking for an interesting version of Wolverine, something more than a classic comic version in resin printed bust form. I don't have the skill and didn't have the time to pull something like that off, a bust really depends on your ability to follow through with the paint job. Not being down on my self, but I knew 2-3 weeks wasn't going to be enough with the little time I'd get to it per day. 



I also started putting together the base. It's a bit of a process, I wanted to use some texture rollers and props I had already bought and printed from [Custom Miniature Maker](https://www.myminifactory.com/users/Custom%20Miniature%20Maker). Together with a quick FDM printed base, I could a solid, textured base that wouldn't just shatter the first time it got bumped.

## Details

I have a subscription to Custom Miniature Maker and they recently published a tavern set with lots of fun props. The texture roller above was also a recent release, when I saw them it clicked: a little bar scene! It made sense as Wolverine loved hanging around in dive bars, and my D20 Logan would fit perfectly in an Olde Timey tavern!

I got the base painted...

and before I could print even more props and background items, disaster struck! A piece of cardboard fell and knocked over Dwogan just as I was getting into the base layers. I haven't switched to the ABS like resins yet, so of course an entire claw was gone. I couldn't find big enough pieces to glue back together, so it was back to stage one. I had to re-print and hope that my new FEP and that new resin would work...

## Calibration 

I won't get into the mind numbing details of the next day. I printed a few calibration prints, and sure enough, I was lucky Dwogan had even come off the FEP. I really couldn't tell if it was my FEP, the new resin or if I just hadn't calibrated everything correctly. After the better part of a day I decided to go for broke. Nothing I had tried worked: I ran exposure tests, I changed lift speeds, I even started over with a new community setting package to see if I could get the bare basics printed. Nothing helped, at all.

What was my last act of desperation? I leveled the bed. Didn't even test it when I was done, just did the resin-in-vat style leveling and started a print. I re-printed the entire thing and...boy did I get lucky. It came out perfect. My bed must have been horribly off, it went from totally failed prints to beauty in the matter of a moments work. Lesson learned, check the basics first. 

Naturally, I wasn't going to tempt fate and get away with it. I forgot that I had left the parts on the plate the first time around and washed the entire thing. I left his arms on the supports but took them off the bed before putting them in my wash and cure. After about two minutes in the wash I heard the impeller hitting the arm. I pulled the tank off the station but it was, of course, too late. I had a new body and one new left arm, but two broken right arms. 

### Go For Broke

Now I was really behind. I had a week, and limited time in that week with work and Christmas events hogging most of my free time. I decided I'd either get everything I need in one print or I'd have to find something else to do for my wifes present. I loaded up (not really loaded up at all) the build plate with a new set of arms and a handful of props I wanted to try. I did a very minimal check for island and resin traps in UV tools and away we went. 

Either I got lucky or I'm getting better at this game, the entire build plate printed and everything looked great! I prepped them as quickly as I could, I wasn't going to be able to paint that night so I did everything else I could to make sure I could get to painting as soon as I got home the next day. I got everything cleaned and left in the enclosure to off gas for the night. 

## Forward Momentum

With all the self made drama over, I got to work. After all this nonsense, I wasn't taking time to take pictures of Dwogan. I was guarding him with my life and focusing on doing the best job I could. I knew it wouldn't be perfect with such little time, but I wanted to give it every bit of effort I could. 

While waiting for layers to dry, I got started on the rest.

A barrel, a stool, and a wee beer! I really wish I'd taken more photos of the entire thing. It's a good lesson, I need to make sure I'm getting pictures or videos if I want to share any of this! Oh well, I'll do better next time. 

As for what I did get, I love the barrel, this is in the middle of doing TMM on the iron bands. I painted them matte black and then used a few different metallics to color the bands. The base and the stool is just...a picture I took.

## The Final Yards

In the end, I just painted as much as I could, switching back and forth between everything I was working on. As one thing dried, I painted something else. I knew I'd regret not getting more pictures, but I was very manic about this project the last few days. I ended up being able to find a few hours every day, and I put them to good use. This is the first dry fit, once I had enough painted to start to glue down painted objects.

And another angle, with less light this time so it came out quite a bit cooler, but I really like both looks!

I couldn't print anything else in time to process it and paint it, and I couldn't think of any basing techniques that might not ruin the base. I only cut one base, which was risky in hindsight. I might be able to print a base, but FDM would look bad and resin would be very hard to get done, I was down to less than 48 hours till I needed to be done. If you think it looks plain, I agree. Another lesson learned. 

I have some sand for bases, as well as some basic terrain cover, flowers and grass etc. But nothing I felt comfortable putting down on a bar floor base, instead of looking like dirt or mud anything I tried might just ruin the whole thing. I set out to push my self, and I did, but I didn't want to push till it was beyond saving. 

In the end, I wanted something to show, and something she'd at least like even if she wasn't blown away. I tried a few different setups, but this simple setup with the keg behind Dwogan as he looked at the viewer. The image at the top of the document is the HDR version, and here are the final pictures I took of the finished product:

## Roundup

This was a very fun project. I'm not satisfied with how it turned out, mostly because there were thing I did that I should have known better than. Such as printing the originals without just doing a level and making sure my printer would be able to print out lots of objects without having to worry about failed prints. I also didn't get nearly creative enough, now that I see the finished piece.
