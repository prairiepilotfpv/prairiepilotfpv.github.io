# A very mini Christmas

I put together a fun little mini diorama as a Christmas gift for my wife. She's a fan of Wolverine and off and on throughout our relationship I like to occasionally drop a unique or unusual bit of Wolverine kitsch as a present. I wanted to do something hand made this year, something that had more effort and time spent than money. I also wanted to focus on using what I already have on hand. I've got lots of models to choose from, plenty of paint and supplies, this is a gift for my wife, not an excuse to buy more stuff. I knew I'd have to get the Wolverine model, so that was my hard cap and I did my looking during [MMF](https://www.myminifactory.com) Black Friday to keep it nice and tidy. 

## Round Up The Essentials

When I saw [Dwogan](https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-dwogan-mithrilclaw-raging-315971) he went straight to my cart. I wasn't sure what I'd do with him, but I knew I could do something with him!

And here he is! He didn't come out perfect, but very close. Truth be told, I didn't have a lot of faith that my FEP replacement and change of resin would hold up, so I took what I got and ran for it. I was looking for an interesting version of Wolverine, something more than a classic comic version in resin printed bust form. I don't have the skill and didn't have the time to pull something like that off, a bust really depends on your ability to follow through with the paint job. Not being down on my self, but I knew 2-3 weeks wasn't going to be enough with the little time I'd get to it per day. 



I also started putting together the base. It's a bit of a process, I wanted to use some texture rollers and props I had already bought and printed from [Custom Miniature Maker](https://www.myminifactory.com/users/Custom%20Miniature%20Maker). Together with a quick FDM printed base, I could a solid, textured base that wouldn't just shatter the first time it got bumped.

## Details

I have a subscription to Custom Miniature Maker and they recently published a tavern set with lots of fun props. The texture roller above was also a recent release, when I saw them it clicked: a little bar scene! It made sense as Wolverine loved hanging around in dive bars, and my D20 Logan would fit perfectly in an Olde Timey tavern!

I got the base painted...

and before I could print even more props and background items, disaster struck! A piece of cardboard fell and knocked over Dwogan just as I was getting into the base layers. I haven't switched to the ABS like resins yet, so of course an entire claw was gone. I couldn't find big enough pieces to glue back together, so it was back to stage one. I had to re-print and hope that my new FEP and that new resin would work...

## Calibration 

I won't get into the mind numbing details of the next day. I printed a few calibration prints, and sure enough, I was lucky Dwogan had even come off the FEP. I really couldn't tell if it was my FEP, the new resin or if I just hadn't calibrated everything correctly. After the better part of a day I decided to go for broke. Nothing I had tried work, I had run exposure test, I had changed lift speeds, I even started over with a new community setting package to see if I could get the bare basics printed to no avail. 

What was my act of desperation? I leveled the bed. Didn't even test it when I was done, just did the resin-in-vat style leveling and started a print. I re-printed the entire thing and...boy did I get lucky. It came out perfect. My bed must have been horribly off, it went from totally failed prints to beauty in the matter of a moments work. Lesson learned, check the basics first. 

Naturally, I wasn't going to tempt fate and get away with it. I forgot that I had left the parts on the plate the first time around and washed the entire thing. I left his arms on the supports but took them off the bed before putting them in my wash and cure. It doesn't help that I was there, but I was. I heard the motor skipped and pull it off. *The same damn arm* was broken at almost the same place.
