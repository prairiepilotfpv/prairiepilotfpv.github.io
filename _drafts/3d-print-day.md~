# PRINTING DAY!

Today is a day to print some stuff, and I'm excited! After a holiday season full of some real joy, and also lots of cleaning and chores, it's good to come home and do something that's just plain enjoyable rather than doing something useful. Well, this is useful to me, but not to the household. Printing bases for my Dwarf Guild squad is not going to make anyone but me happy, but it will eventually make me very happy! 

Really, I just want to see my printers work, I love the process of printing. It always makes me happy to hear them whir away making something for one of my hobbies or something around the house. But! I don't print just to print, I can't afford nonsense prints.

 I need to print 4 more bases for the units I have printed at this moment. I'll also print some extra for the next squad I print, I've got something rattling around in my head to do my own bases but I don't want to stop working on units while I figure it out. It should be really cool, but right now I need some resin bases. 

I also need a small utility print, something very specific that I can hopefully design quickly on Fusion. Those are famous last words, but I'm confident I can figure out a working version, if not state of the art. I love afternoons like this, especially since I know this is definitely going to turn into several afternoons I'll *have* to spend finishing these projects. 

## Dwarf Guild Bases

I have no problem doing small prints with resin, it doesn't bother me to just fire one thing off that I need. When I can though, I'd much rather print a whole plate, process a whole plate and have a pile of stuff to work on. I have an enclosure and all the gear for resin printing, but it's still not fun doing all that work. Much better to just pack all the discomfort into the smallest area possible. 

I didn't really fill the plate just doing the bases I needed, so I'll take this free space to print some more bottle toppers. I don't see a lot of people online who use them, printed tops you glue onto your bottles that you can paint over. Lots of people use dots or swatches, but I have trouble abstracting what a color will look like. Being able to look at something with a real shape (skulls in this case) that has been primed and painted helps me when I'm mixing or even just choosing base layers. 

It's hard to deny that there is a bit of printing just to print, but I do really want to get my entire paint collection topped. So it would really be a waste *not* to fill the plate with some paint toppers.
