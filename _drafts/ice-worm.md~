# Wonderful worm

I am still working on setting up a game of Frostgrave with my wife, and something I'm missing (one of many, many things) is an ice worm monster. I actually need more than one, as the random system can spawn more than one, but let's keep it simple for now. I got distracted from working on my Frostgrave minis when I got into One Page Rules, so now that winter is truly upon us, it's about time to get serious about Frostgrave. We've made our wizards, but we still haven't gotten a game together or put together our warband, this ice worm is a good step towards having what I need to set us up!

## Inspiration 

When I saw this sculpt by Reddit user /u/Many_Many it seemed like exactly what I wanted from an Ice Worm sculpt for Frostgrave. It's clearly a fantasy giant worm, but it's very unique. Not another Dune style worm or a sausage with teeth, it's got it's own menacing vibe. Generously, the model was free so I downloaded it right away. 

Once I got a closer look in Lychee it was even cooler than I thought. I hadn't noticed the spines jutting out of the side and I didn't realize the rocky base was modeled. I printed it ASAP, and it came out perfectly. Shortly thereafter I had printer problems (see first post for details) so I'm even luckier this came out so darn perfect. 

I had a lot to do at the end of 2023, and by "the end" I mean basically from mid-October on. Since I knew I wouldn't be able to spend the sort of time I want to, I cleaned it up, primed it and put a quite zenithal down before putting it in a safe space on it's stand, ready to paint when its time comes!
