# Wonderful worm

As usual, I tried to start something and got distracted. That's sort of my thing, way more often than I'd like. Despite good intentions of starting a game of Frostgrave with my wife a year ago, I got sidetracked many, *many* times. Well, I finally found some focus (IE: I was prescribed Adderal) and now I'm ready to get back to it. 

I need monsters, lots of monsters. I have some zombies and skeletons, but I need so much more. Bears, wolves, various demons and constructs and of course no fantasy setting is complete without their very own worm! In Frostgrave there are "normal" ice worms and giant ice worms. I really want to get playing sooner than later, so rather than getting tied up with another model that will take me weeks, it's time to get a damn worm painted!

## Love at first sight 

When I saw this sculpt by Reddit user /u/Many_Many it seemed like exactly what I wanted. The sculpt reads as a large, menacing worm at a glance but it doesn't immediately lock you into any specific settings. It's scary, but it could be a sand worm, a water worm, or in my case: an ice worm. The sculpt its self was beautiful and I knew I wanted to paint it even if I never used it. 

I didn't really have any particular idea beyond how much I liked the sculpt and the idea that I wanted an ice worm that wasn't just white and blue. I've seen some really cool ice themed minis, and my favorites weren't painted in typical ice and snow colors. I tried to find some good visual references but I didn't love what I found. All blue and white, and any fantasy images I found were very distinct and I didn't want to end up copying someone elses wonderful work. 

So all I could do was prime it and get to work. 

## primer

Nothing special here, I use Badger Stylrenz airbrush primer. In this case I had primed the mini a while ago and had given it a standard black primer with white zenithal. If I'd thought about it more at the time, I would rather have painted it up from black but I wasn't going to dull the details with another coat of primer. 

## base coat

I don't mind priming and base coat, even when I'm not using any Contrast style paints. This sculpt was no exception. As soon as I got a first coat on the model already looked more interesting. I wasn't sure about the zenithal at first, but I quickly decided I already love the look of this monster. 

## details

As usual, a quick paint turned into another practice session since I have no self control. I really wanted to nail down some *smooth* gradients on the carapace and tied my self into knots in the attempt. Eventually I came out of the fugue state I seem to enter when I dive into the details on a mini and realized I had a **lot** more monsters and soldiers to paint and I needed to get a move on. 

In the end, I gave the entire thing a coat of blue wash and damn if it didn't tie the whole thing together. They call it liquid talent for a reason I suppose.

## base

For many months now I've been rolling and cutting my own ceramic bases so it was a bit of a relief being able to just get to painting without a lot of gluing and priming. Originally I hoped to be able to make the rubble at the base of the worm look like ice blocks but I just don't have the skills to have that much white and blue on the model with the kind of contrast it would need. Not yet anyway, I'm getting better every model.

## ready to rumble

And here we are. In absolute time, this took months. I put off even printing the model for far too long, and then dallied for even longer. Really, I was scared to ruin it. Which is sort of silly since I print my minis, but in the cold half of the year I wasn't looking forward to spending any more time in the cold garage where I keep my printer. Still, it was a pretty lame excuse. Not to get too preachy or drift into a therapy session, but putting something off because I don't think I'm good enough has plagued me for far too long. It's easy to say "don't be afraid to fail" but another thing to take a model you're really excited to paint and risk ruining it or forever wishing you'd done a better job. 

I'm glad I dove it and got to it. It turned out great, I'm really very happy with it. I do want to keep getting better, I was frustrated I wasn't able to blend colors on the scaly parts, but the important part is I gave it a really good shot and it does look great. I do feel like I learned something too even if I couldn't exactly teach a class on painting an icy look.
