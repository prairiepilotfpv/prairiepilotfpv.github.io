# Time Fly's

As usual, I've been gone for far too long. Another catch up post, another attempt to get this thing up and running on a regular basis. I'm not gonna promise to anyone, even my self, that I'm going to get into better habits re my blog, but I'm sure gonna try. 


## What have I been doing?

Gosh, I've been so busy, I don't even know where to start. A few weeks ago, almost a month ago now, I walked out of my long term job. I'd been there almost 6 years, just a few weeks shy actually. I had been having trouble getting my boss to pitch in and be part of the team anyway, and that day I decided I'd just had enough. I put my stuff on the counter and walked out after telling my boss I'm done. It was very nice and very freeing, but also very stressful at the time. 

Took a few weeks off to relax and catch my breath after years of running around at top speed constantly then got back to work. While I was home, I made sure to get lots of stuff done, take photos of none of it, and get nowhere with my blog, of course. 

It was still good, I'm glad I quit and I'm glad I took a few weeks off. It was getting to be a real nightmare going in every morning, and I was falling way behind on everything. Working 6-2, six or seven days a week eventually gets to where you just can't function properly. Or at least I couldn't, not with my ADHD and horrible bed time habits. It had been a long time coming, and I'm glad I moved on. 

## What AM I doing?

Well, of course I have to pay the bills, so I started a new job. Not really important, but it's more 9-5 and much less stressful. It also allows time to catch my breath, and to actually function like a useful human. Working so early, and having so much stress and quick action just killed me after years and years. 

But that's boring! Jobs are for paying bills, not for enjoying life. So how am I doing enjoying life? Pretty darn good! 

## Return to the frozen city! 

Finally got my first game of Frostgrave in with my wife. We played two games and it was delightful! Its not nearly as hard to setup as I had thought, and it was very easy to play. After more than a year, maybe two years, of trying to get started with mini war games and really all I needed was some figures and some stuff to act as terrain. Did I learn my lesson, am I ready to play at the drop of the hat now that I know it's so simple? No! Now that I know it's so fun, I want MORE overly detailed figures and terrain! I  do have enough terrain and minis to play, so I'm not totally shooting my self in the foot. 

I'm working on a terrain set from Makers Anvil, the Ruined Stronghold set. It's exactly what I was looking for, a middle of the road fantasy set of various ruined building. The stronghold its self is huge and will be an eye catching center piece when I bring it out. I'm also moving away from grinding out soldiers for our war bands and focusing on the baddies. Finally, it's time to get a little *evil*. I'm working on videos showing all this off, I think it probably makes more sense to show then to tell. I am very excited though, I've got quite a few monster STLs just gathering dust on my hard drive, waiting to come to life!

Frostgrave is all about exploring the frozen city of Felstad, fighting off dangerous monsters and your fellow wizards to leave with the loot. Right now, the dangerous enemies are...a handful of skeletons and some zombies. I have a pretty cool ice worm I loved painting, and maybe 1-2 other monsters I could dig out of my bin. That's just not enough monster! We need to get way more monsters in here! Can't wait to show you the demon, construct and frost giant I've got primed and ready to go !

## Wars and Hammers

Waaaaaay back in April, I got a Warhammer 40,000 Combat Patrol, the old Sisters of Battle set that people liked so much. Since then, I've mindlessly bought another $300.00 worth of sisters, as well as a bunch of Kill Team boxes. Why? I have no self control, that is why. 

Really though, Warhammer was always on my vision board. I've loved the world of Warhammer since I found out about Warhammer: Fantasy Battles back the in the early 90's. When I saw 40K, I fell in love. Back then it was very difficult for a small town kid with no extra cash to find a way into the actual game. Once I was an adult, I just never had the money or time to get into the game. Also, Games Workshop today and GW 10-15 years ago are two very different. Ol'James Workshop makes it MUCH easier to get into the game. Between starter sets, online rules and actually letting outlets sell their products without a $12k buy in, it's WAY easier to get into Warhammer. 

Which is all to say, I'm finally getting into Warhammer 40K. Right now I'm painting the Marines in a starter set I bought for the paint. I want to get some practice putting together simple models before I open up the combat patrol and start putting Sisters together. I'm really excited to build up a nice SoB force. Say what you will about plastic crack, or how expensive it is, I'm really pumped to be part of a vibrant community. This isn't 1997, war gaming isn't neck beards arguing over cover rules, it's a really cool game and a really cool world surrounding it and I'm very excited to get into it. 

Which leads me to my next point, which is more Warhammer...but deadlier!

## Team and kills? 

I dunno, I just like to put funny things in my section headers. I'm playing Kill Team this year! In fact, I won a very well painted set of Imperial Navy Breachers that will work nicely to get into the season starting in September. What a fun time to get into Kill Team, what with the new version finally announced. It should ship in October, and I can't wait. The whole thing looks great, same rules but refreshed and simplified, new models, new teams and a new season. I really can't wait. 

I have 3 more kill teams ready to build and paint, and I'm also working on a Votann proxy team to use at home with my family. I've been putting off this stuff for a while, out of intimidation maybe. I just didn't want to ruin all my lovely battle sisters, and the Kill Team boxes sitting on my shelf are gathering dust for similar reasons. But, as I continue to work on my self now that I'm sober and medicated, I'm finally at a point where I want to have FUN with my stuff! So as I clear out my piles to make room for the new stuff, getting those Kill Teams up and running so I can actually play in the new season is a big priority. 

## I swear that's it. 

I actually bit the bullet and went through my projects with a gimlet eye. Between ADHD, my old job and being busy with family, I let a lot of projects sort of pile up. Upon reflection, a lot of them got put aside. I'm finishing a few of them, but a handful of models were put in the storage bin for now. I really want to actually *play* the games I'm working on, so I probably don't need to worry about re-wiring my network or updating my Home Assistant when they're both working perfectly fine. 

And really, here on August 26th as I write this, that's been the point of this year and the last few years. Figuring out what I actually like to do, and re-learning how to have fun. Addiction is a hell of a thing, and drinking like an idiot for 15 years robbed me not just of my independence, my family time and my health, it also destroyed my hobbies. I forgot how to have fun, since the only thing I really did for entertainment since 2009 was going home and getting shit faced. Sobering up, getting medicated and trying to get back into the stuff I enjoyed has been much harder than I thought it would be. 

Turns out, fun isn't quite as easy as it is when you're a kid. I don't remember how to just relax and have fun. Also, I'm keenly aware of the wasted time and potential, so I can hardly pick up a paintbrush without criticizing my self. Before I've even butchered the paint job! That's just no way to live, and I'm happy to say I'm finally moving past it. I'm getting to where I truly enjoy sitting down to paint or play and even though I still have that voice of doubt and criticism in my head, it's getting easier and easier to silence that voice and get on with living. 


## Goodbye

That's all folks, that's where I've been for three more months. Again, let's hope this isn't a one off. Till the next time, enjoy your hobbies, love your families, and have a wonderful day!
