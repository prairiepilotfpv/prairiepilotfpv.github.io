# Introduction

## Why?

With my 40's starting me dead in the eye, and my days of drunken chaos behind me, I've had to do a bit of figuring out who I am. Self identification is easy when you're the friend/son/partner that always has a beer in their hand. Nowadays, I take medication for the things in my brain that don't work, and I don't really want to spend my nights stumbling into walls or breaking shit. 

Well, it's been a long time since I've had to actually decide what to do with my time. Between ADHD and a love of intoxicating beverages (and plants) my time took care of its self. Just whipped by without a lot of interaction on my part.
