# Title/subtitle

## Intro

Goodness, it's september! Already! Time flys, as stated earlier. I enjoy the short week, but it is throwing me off a bit. I also have a trade show I'm working at the end of the week which is stressing me out and making the week seem even shorter. 

### Twitter Sucks

Speaking of which, I had to start a Twitter account for my new job and good lord, what a trash fire. Everything suggested to me was right wing garbage with ol'Muskrat leading the charge. Thank goodness for the EU and their privacy rules, it's a pain to block people, but it's doable. I'm not sure who he thinks he's going to sway by shoving the dumbest, most embarassing examples of his audience down our throat. All it did was waste some time blocking blue check idiots. 

### The internet was a mistake

I've been enjoying one of the dumbest, funniest fights I've ever seen on Reddit. I'm not going to link to the subs, but I'm sure you'll be able to find them. Basically, a niche Warhammer sub is in a bloody, drawn out brawl over the defintion of what is, or isn't, suitable for the niche subs rules. They are troll posting each other, they are harranging the mods, it's an all out war *just between the people in the sub.* 

Believe it or not but Warhammer Reddit is *generally* a pretty nice place to hang out. There is a lot of toxicity in the community at large, so the mods and the users are all pretty proactive about keeping the sludge away. The big subs, the small faction specific subs, etc etc, they're all usually very peaceful and tolerant. Not today, and it's making me so happy. 

Nothing like casually scrolling your Reddit feed while enjoying a morning tea, and finding a nice post where a bunch of grown adults who just want to talk about old Warhammer stuff are gouging each others eyes out. It's too darn funny seeing such a niche, friendly sub go knives out, it's on sight mode. 

## Order. Established. 

I have been putting off starting my Adeptus Sororitas army for a while. I got the old Combat Patrol back in April, for my birthday as a matter of fact. It's been almost five months, and I haven't even opened the box. I haven't opened any of my Sisters boxes, even though I've now got about 1000 points of sisters, some Imperial Agents and the Codexii to build it. For some reason though, I've just been putting it off. 

### Fear the fear. 

It's really not hard to figure out why I've been putting it off: I just don't want to ruin them. I don't want to spend hours and hour painting just to bring them to a game and be laughed at. Since my brain hates me, I'll read it as harsh critiszm even if someone just don't like it. It's been dragging me down for a while and it's getting really old. 

Not that I haven't had fun painting all the minis I've printed, and once my wife is done with our living room redecorating, we should have more time for Frostgrave, but there is just something about Games Workshop models that feels different. They cost money, like actual cash, which is a big difference. If I ruin a mini I printed, who cares, I'll just print another one for $0.05. Having to strip a model or having to re-buy something I've ruined was stressing me out. 

It's not just simple perfomance anxiety though. After wondering why I keep finding excuses to put off building my army I think I realized what was holding me back. It's really dumb, but really simple: Warhammer is special. It's *not* just another game, or just *any old* models. It's **Warhammer**. The Sisters Of Battle deserve better than my meager skills can provide! 

Really, it's being 40 and not being able to shake the feeling of being a broke 13 year old kid who just wants to play table top games and can't even get close to Warhammer. By the late 90's when I was starting to really get into tabletop gaming, Warhammer was already known as an expensive, elite hobby. Back then, a store couldn't buy in for less than $8-$12k. That's a LOT of money for a mom and pop gaming store circa 1998-2000. So even finding the models was hard, let alone playing. 

When some kid from rural Wyoming DID get a chance to play, or to even see them, they were impossibly cool. Yes, those 2-3rd ed sculpts blew me away as a teen.
