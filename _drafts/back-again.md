# Boy Howdy

It's been a long time since I've posted here. This blog was meant to be a clearinghouse for my thoughts and a tool for accountability. I had dreams of a picture-perfect blog, with fun little photos and a nice ToC for every post.

It was a nice idea, and I don't think I was totally wrong—or I wouldn't be here writing this, would I? The truth is, I had a good idea and did try to follow through, but my mental health and the way I pursue hobbies just weren't in the right place. Trying to maintain that idealized blog became more stress than it was worth.

## Bad Habits

Since getting on meds and trying to be more functional, I've struggled to enjoy myself even when doing things I *do* enjoy. There’s been a log jam in my head where I can't just relax and have fun. Through most of '23 and '24, I clenched my teeth through everything until I burned out. I stopped working on almost everything, played lots of video games, and limped through the holidays.

I told myself I'd get back to work on my projects as soon as—well, something happened. There was always something. Eventually, I ran out of excuses and had to think about why I didn’t want to do the things I supposedly loved.

There was something I wasn't able to put a finger on that was hanging me up. Something that made me stop before I started. It was a feeling, a mood. I wasn't sitting around, waiting for motivation, I was actively trying to cultivate discipline and working on beloved projects filled me with dread. 

Before long, I settled into a rhythm: work all day, miserable I wasn’t doing my projects, get home and find a good reason to not work on a project. Too tired from the day, can't focus, just not in the mood. I'd get that feeling, that something I couldn't identify, and wile away my afternoon dreaming of being productive. 

## Do It My Way

Ultimately, it came down to mindset. Not my meds, diet, or even sleep—though I always need more sleep, and cutting caffeine helped me think more clearly. The problem was me. I *was* my own worst enemy. At 20, that was a funny thing to admit. At 40, I’m just tired of it, it's not cute being a middle aged man that can't even paint some Warhammer mini's without raking my self over the coals. 

When your internal monologue is all criticism and self-abuse, you don’t improve. Instead of enjoying the process, I built a checklist of mistakes until I gave up. I’d drive an hour to take photos, spend the whole ride berating myself, then take one picture, frown, and go home. I could go on with the few other things I try to do, not even really full hobbies, little things that should be fun. 

## Some Light

So I gave up—on my own terms. I didn’t spiral into another dark day or wait for a dopamine high to push me into action. I just stepped back. Mini painting, videos, 3D printing—all of it went on the shelf. If I felt like doing something, I did. Otherwise, it gathered dust. I kept my camera on me, mostly out of guilt, but stopped forcing myself to use it daily.

I used to look down on people who took breaks from hobbies. How do you improve by not doing the thing? But it *was* a break I needed. It was a relief to not panic every time I got home, thinking I had to immediately start something productive. I resisted that urge to punish myself for not doing enough, or not doing it right. And you know what? I felt better.

## Back in the Saddle

This isn’t some grand turning point. Just another step I missed in early adulthood.

I built a mindset that punished anything less than perfection. If I couldn’t one-shot a project, it wasn’t worth doing. Time off helped me realize how that thinking robbed the joy and learning from the process.

A huge part of growth is recognizing how you talk to yourself. Even fun things got put through the wringer. Alex, why aren’t you better at this yet? That thinking builds up. The more I tried and failed, the more ammo I had to tear myself apart next time I dared to try.

## What Now?

Eventually, I couldn’t stand avoiding my hobbies. So I returned—with one rule: enjoy myself. Whether that’s short sprints, zoning out with a podcast, spending two hours on a mini with nothing to show for it—fine. As long as I’m enjoying the process.

Part of that is choosing what I work on. I got so caught up in what I *should* do, I forgot to think about what I *want* to do. Sometimes I’d even change my method to match what’s "right." No more of that. Unless I’m just procrastinating, I’ll follow my interest.

Another lesson I’m still learning: take pride in what I’ve done. I was raised by people proud of how hard they were on themselves. My mom was a baker who taught me to always see the flaws others miss. That works if you’re a master refining your craft. It’s not so helpful when you’re just trying to improve at painting minis.

So now, I *look* at my finished minis. I take a moment to appreciate when a design works. If I nail it on the first print, I actually celebrate it. I let myself feel proud.

## Relax, Don't Do It

At the core, I’ve just been my own worst enemy. I’m too old to cling to habits and thoughts that hold me back. Doesn’t matter where I learned it or why—it doesn’t help anyone. Especially as I see old age on the horizon, I don’t want to be the bitter old man who never learned to let go. It doesn’t feel good being mean to myself anymore.

I’m not a brand new man. It’s not a brand new day. But I *can* see light on the horizon. I can take decent photos. I *can* paint to a high standard. I’m not bad at designing things for print.

The point is to enjoy life, failures and all. Even if I stay mediocre, I’ll be okay. As long as I get the damn thing done.
