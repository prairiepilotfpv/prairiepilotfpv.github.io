Frostgrave is a tabletop wargame set in a fantasy setting centered around looting the thawing remains of a once great city "Felstad." My wife and I have had a great time playing Magic: The Gathering and Pirates of the Sword Coast and I have been wanting another tabletop wargame for us to enjoy together.

After a year of, if I'm honest, farting around, I finally found the focus and organization to get started on printing/painting enough units to cover two warbands and a nice stable of enemies to combat. This is a long term, and ongoing, project that I have wanted to document for a long time. This page will serve as a hub for my various Frostgrave related projects. Minis, terrain, story, game write-ups, anything I think of that's directly related to Frostgrave. You'll find links to blog posts with Frostgrave updates or when Project Report videos relevant to Frostgrave are released.
