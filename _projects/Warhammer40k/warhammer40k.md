I have loved Warhammer since I was first introduced to Warhammer Fantasy Battles in the mid ninties. When I saw the iconic boxes for Warhammer 40k, third edition, I was hooked. While I haven't always been the most fervernt fan, I've had a soft spot for Warhammer for almost as long as I can remember. Not a soft spot, a yearnig, as it was totally out the realm of possiblity for me for a long time. Now that it's common, I've spent the last few years putting my love of Warhammer into action and began playing Warhammer 40k and Warhammer 40k: KilL Team in the last few years.
