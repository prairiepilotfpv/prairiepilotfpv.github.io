## The Usual Drama

I'm 39, a recovering alcoholic, diagnosed with ADHD in my late thirties, all the usual stuff. Naturally I'm nerdy and hobby crazy, but that's settled down quite a bit since I quit drinking and started taking meds/treatment for ADHD. Now I've just got the tiny handful, not more than 3-4...

This is just my space to try and actually follow through with some more projects and make note of the process. I enjoy writing, photography and making videos, but day to day I much prefer simple hobbies like 3D printing or painting minis, along with as much home automation as I can afford or my family will tolerate. 

Probably not much in the way of how-tos or tutorials, more an expression of joy in the things I do to keep busy.
