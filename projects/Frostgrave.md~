## Where to begin?

Frostgrave is a tabeltop wargame set in a fantasy setting centered around looting the thawing remains of a once great city "Felstad." My wife and I have had a great time playing Magic: The Gathering and Pirates of the Sword Coast and I have been wanting another tabletop wargame for us to enjoy together.
