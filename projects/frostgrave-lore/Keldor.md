# Keldor Rises: Homebrew lore


## Keldor, of The Kingdom of Darrik

---

In a small, coastal nation to the south of the frozen city, a people fond of magic and conflict thrived in the centuries since the great catastrophe to the north. Since the world was changed, the people of Darrik have thrived and built a martial society. In many ways might makes right to the people of Darrik, be it might of fist or sword, or might of magic. It is in this place that Keldor the summoner was born and raised. 

Darrik is not known for a great number of magical schools or temples, but they are well respected for the strength of those who do choose to learn the ways of magic in this isolated place. For reasons unknown to those who study such things, Darrik produces an unusual number of Summoners considering the small population of mages who hail from Darrik. The only magical school of any note is a summoning cabal that trains a small handful of magic users a year. 

And so it is that Keldor learned the arts of the summoner, having little choice as he was hungry to learn to harness his magical powers. He excelled as soon as he joined the reclusive mages that made up the summoners cabal. Though young and naive to the ways of magic he took to the skills of a summoner immediately. By the time he was a young man he has mastered the basic of summoning and began adventuring to find more education in the magical arts, and to find his fame and fortune.
